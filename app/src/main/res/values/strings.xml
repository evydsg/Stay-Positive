And for that, I am thankful.\nOne small positive thought in the morning can change my whole day. So, today I rise with a powerful thought to set the tone and allow success to reverberate through every moment of my day.\nI set goals and go after them with all the determination I can muster. When I do this, my own skills and talents will take me to places that amaze me.\nHappiness is a choice, and today I choose to be happy.</string>
